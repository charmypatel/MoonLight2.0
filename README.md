# Moonlight2.0 - Using Processing | Owl Hacks 2020

**Updated Features:**

This project is a continuation of Moonlight with added features. The project used Processing which is a graphical library
that helps non-programmers learn how to code in a visual context. The added features of the project include: an owl sitting 
on the crescent, color change of the crescent (to only white), and added play, pause, and shuffle buttons that are made visible 
for the user when the project runs. These features were add so the user no longer has to change their code if they want to play, 
pause, or shuffle music. Once the user enteres their music list into the code, that list is saved and can be used throughout the animation.

**Group Members:** I worked on this project solo during Temple University's Owl Hacks 2020 virtual event.

**Purpose:** Now that everyone is taking classes virtually, this animation can be played while meeting rooms are taking a break, or when the host is 
waiting for people to join the meeting.

**Old Version Details:**

Moonlight is a group project that I worked on for my CIS111B - Java Part 2 course while pursing my Information Science &
Technology A.S degree at Montgomery County Community College. The project used Processing which is a graphical library
that helps non-programmers learn how to code in a visual context. I worked on this project as the lead programmer along
with two other students for about two months with no prior knowledge about Processing.Songs can be added to a list and then played
and paused only through code. Also the animation changes based on the frequency of the current song. For more information regarding the project please
